# Enterprise Architecture Pattern

## Abstract
This document defines what the contents of an **Enterprise Architecture Pattern** document should be for value to be derived by the **Solution Architect** and the **Solution Team** when defining an **Enterprise Solution Design**. The purpose of this document is to define the data that must be maintained by a **Solution Team** to properly register the application to keep the solution in alignment with enterprise strategy.

## Requirements

- A pattern should be defined to apply across multiple designs/solutions.  
- A minimum set of patterns, are defined, that **must** be addressed in a design/solution.
- Patterns are derived directly from **Architecture Principles** which links to published strategy and/or from established services being provided in the enterprise.
- Patterns should define specific data that should be maintained by the **Solution Team** in the **Enterprise Solution Design**.
- The specific data to collect forms the non-functional 

## Contents

A good pattern should identify the specific data (non-functional requirements) to be maintained by the **Solution Team** for a specific soltuion.

## Scope

A **good** pattern should seek to define a set **Capabilities:

1. **Scalability**: The architecture should be able to accommodate growth in terms of data volume, user numbers, and business complexity.
2. **Flexibility**: The architecture should be flexible enough to adapt to changing business requirements and technologies.
3. **Modularity**: The architecture should be composed of independent, modular components that can be easily replaced or upgraded.
4. **Reusability**: The architecture should be designed to allow for reuse of components and patterns across different areas of the enterprise.
5. **Security**: The architecture should include appropriate security measures to protect data and systems from unauthorized access and breaches.
6. **Performance**: The architecture should be designed to provide good performance in terms of speed, responsiveness and availability.
7 **Integration**: The architecture should facilitate integration of different systems and applications, both within the enterprise and with external systems.
8. **Governance**: The architecture should include a governance framework that ensures compliance with standards, policies, and best practices.
9. **Interoperability**: The architecture should allow different systems and applications to communicate and share data with each other.
10. **Simplicity**: The architecture should be as simple as possible, with a minimal number of layers, components, and dependencies.

A good enterprise architecture pattern should also consider the specific needs of the organization and the industry it operates in, and should be able to evolve over time to adapt to new technologies and changing business requirements.
