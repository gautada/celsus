# Data Retention

Data retention is important for an enterprise because it helps to ensure that important information is not lost, and can be accessed as needed. It also helps to meet legal and regulatory requirements, such as those related to financial reporting or data privacy. Data retention allows an enterprise to maintain an accurate record of its activities, which can be helpful for making business decisions, identifying trends, and solving problems. Additionally, having a data retention policy in place can help to protect an enterprise's reputation by ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked or misused.

# Strategies

There are three categories of data retention strategy:

1. **Archiving**: This involves moving older or infrequently accessed data to a separate storage location, such as tape or cloud storage, to free up space on primary storage systems.
2. **Backup**: This involves regularly creating copies of important data and storing them in a secure location, such as an off-site facility or the cloud, to protect against data loss due to hardware failure or other incidents.
3. **Synchronization**: This involves maintaining multiple copies of live data across physical or virtual locations for performance, failover, and/or availability. 

## Primary Features

There are four primary features of Data Retention that must be defined for a data retention design.

1. **Data Classification**: This involves categorizing data based on its importance and sensitivity, and is used when implementing different retention and protection strategies for each category.
2. **Data Governance**: This involves establishing clear roles and responsibilities for managing and protecting data, as well as implementing policies and procedures for data retention and access.
3. **Auditing**: This involves regularly reviewing and analyzing data usage and access to detect and prevent potential data breaches, as well as to ensure compliance with retention policies.
4. **Retention Policies**: This involves setting specific retention periods for different types of data and automatically deleting or archiving data that has reached the end of its retention period.


In an enterprise, data can be categorized in various ways depending on the organization's specific needs. However, some common categories of data that are typically found in an enterprise include:

Financial data: This includes financial records, such as invoices, purchase orders, and financial statements.
Customer data: This includes information about customers, such as contact information, purchase history, and demographics.
Employee data: This includes information about employees, such as contact information, job titles, and salaries.
Product data: This includes information about products or services offered by the enterprise, such as descriptions, pricing, and inventory levels.
Operational data: This includes data related to the day-to-day operations of the enterprise, such as production schedules, inventory levels, and logistics information.
Marketing data: This includes data related to marketing campaigns, such as customer segmentation data, lead lists, and campaign results.
Legal and regulatory data: This includes data related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, such as contracts, licenses, and permits.
Intellectual property data: This includes data related to patents, trademarks, and other forms of intellectual property.
Sensitive data: This includes data that is considered sensitive, such as personal information, company confidential information, and data that should be protected by law.




## 3-2-1 Backup

3-2-1 backup is a data backup strategy that involves creating three copies of important data, on two different types of media, and storing one copy off-site. The idea is that if one copy of the data is lost or corrupted, there are still two other copies available. This strategy provides a high level of protection against data loss due to hardware failure, natural disasters, or other types of incidents. The three copies can be made on hard drive, cloud or any other storage media.
