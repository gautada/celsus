# Target Audience for Architecture Diagrams

For practicality purposes the number of deliverables provided by an architect should be limited and directed toward a specific use.  To achieve this we need to maintain a specific list of diagram and the intended target audience.

## Context Diagram

- *Business Owner*: Shows where the data comes from and where the data produced is use. Upstream/Downstream
- *Project Manager*: Provides the scope of technology that limites the bredth of the impacted teams/technology

## Container Diagram

- *Technology Team*: Defines the shared services that the tech ownership team needs to interact with.

## Component Diagram

- *Technical Developer*: Started by the architect but completed by the technology team provides the blueprint for using the system for a technical aspect.

## Deployment Diagram

- *IT Resource Planning*: This is kinda a catchall group that ulitmately consumes the solution to procure tech or implement services as required.
