# Proclamation for Technical Architecture

As technical architects we strive to benefit the enterprise by by providing a multiplyer of technical innovation, we push to increase speed to value of technology initiatives, and we directly effect the fiduciary management of technology. To achieve these goals we value: 

- Practical over theoretical
- Valuable over specified
- Desired Output over a collection of approved artifacts.

While there is value and sometimes need for the items on the right we value the items on the left more.
