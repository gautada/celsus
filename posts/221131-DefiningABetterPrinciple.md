# Defining a better principle

As I look around the internet hunting for examples to incorporate into my architecture practice I keep coming back to the notion that architecture 
principles are well defined but are poorly followed. Take for instance **TOGAF --** "Principles are general rules and guidelines, intended to be 
enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission. In their turn, principles 
may be just one element in a structured set of ideas that collectively define and guide the organization, from values through to actions and 
results." This is a good definition, but as I review actual printed architecture principles from various enterprises I get gems like:

- The Customer Experience should prevail over cost and time to market.
- Model the organization based on the design of the system
- Achieve safe, sound, iterative improvment using "software defined everything"

Ok seriously, what?

On the surface these principles seem great "Mission" level statements that once defined would rarely change and provide a true north star 
for all of us to strive to achieve. But are they practical? 

So...

Customer experience should prevail... 
- No MVP
- Forget TCO - we have plenty of money
- Who exactly defines customer experience and has this veto over when we are done?

Model the organization off the system...
- OK IT tell the business "How" to go make money.
- Let's define copetitive advantage as, "We all do it the way the vendor says."
- Systems never have flaws or bugs, just accept that fact.

..."software defined everything"
- I saw this episode of [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/)
- What group approved adopting a [marketing phrase](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/software-defined-everything/)?
- **Rasing hand** I get iterative improvement but ***safe** and **sound** what now?

All joking aside I think I have cracked te proverbial nut in what makes a good principle.  

A good principle consists of all of the following:

- A statement, that sets out an A over B scenario. 
- Must be derived from an authoratative source
- Immediately put intio use

## Good Principles Have

### A over B scenario

The best examle of this is in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifestor.org) where they clearly defined "That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more."  This makes for clear, and easily understood statements that can be followed.  This allows for principles
to not be dogmatic like "Model this way..." or presecriptive with "Achieve X with Y".  This approach presents a guide to the target state.

### Derived from Authoratative Source

So 


Enterprise Principles provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise, and inform how the organization sets about fulfilling its mission
Such principles are commonly found as a means of harmonizing decision-making across an organization. In particular, they are a key element in a successful Architecture Governance strategy (see 44. Architecture Governance).

Within the broad domain of enterprise principles, it is common to have subsidiary principles within a business or organizational unit. Examples include IT, HR, domestic operations, or overseas operations. These principles provide a basis for decision-making within the subsidiary domain and will inform architecture development within the domain. Care must be taken to ensure that the principles used to inform architecture development align to the organizational context of the Architecture Capability.

Architecture Principles are a set of principles that relate to architecture work
They reflect a level of consensus across the enterprise, and embody the spirit and thinking of existing enterprise principles. Architecture Principles govern the architecture process, affecting the development, maintenance, and use of the Enterprise Architecture.

It is common to have sets of principles form a hierarchy, in that segment principles will be informed by, and elaborate on, the principles at the enterprise level. Architecture Principles will be informed and constrained by enterprise principles.

Architecture Principles may restate other enterprise guidance in terms and form that effectively guide architecture development.
