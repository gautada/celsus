# Architecture Principle

An architecture principle is a defined preference for target state. Typically in the real world this means that principles become guides
in our journey that point us to the correct path. Most definitions of architecture princple attempt to limit the concept to unbreakable 
or undeniable truth. This limit will cause practical problems in that a principle defined as such cannot be changed or deviated from. This 
is a major issue for many architecture groups.  A far better definition is that from [Marriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/principle):

```
principle (noun)
prin·​ci·​ple ˈprin(t)-s(ə-)pəl  -sə-bəl
1 a: a comprehensive and fundamental law, doctrine, or assumption
  b(1): a rule or code of conduct
   (2): habitual devotion to right principles (a man of principle)
  c: the laws or facts of nature underlying the working of an artificial device
2: a primary source : ORIGIN
3 a: an underlying faculty or endowment (such principles of human nature as greed and curiosity)
  b: an ingredient (such as a chemical) that exhibits or imparts a characteristic quality
4: capitalized Christian Science  : a divine principle : GOD
```

For architecture we nned to concetraite on the definitions excluding 1 b(2), 1 c, and 4. This allows for an exploration of what an architecture 
principle is and how one is pracically used.
