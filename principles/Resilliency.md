# Resilliency Principle

Architecture will support the approriate Resilliency for all solutions to support the business. Typically, providing more Resilliency is a cost to the overall solution. However, when compared to a failure of the business (system, solution, process) the cost can easily be offset with one disaster and proper recovery or completely avoiding incidents that effect the business. 

This principle is typically defined though a series of classifications that group the solution with pre-determined/defined outcomes that are acceptable to the business owner's.

## Examples

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO): A target of the amount of time to recover the system after an outage.

- **Tier0:** RTO: 0-2 Hours (Max: 2hrs)  
- **Tier1:** RTO: 2-8 Hours (Max: 8hrs)
- **Tier2:** RTO: 8-24 Hours (Max: 24hrs)
- **Tier3:** RTO: 24-48 Hours (Max: 48hrs)
- **Tier4:** RTO: 48-72 Hours (Max: 72hrs)
- **Tier5:** RTO: 72-168 Hours (Max: 168hrs)
- **Tier6:** RTO 168+ Hours
- **Tier7:** Ad-Hoc Recovery
